summary: A juju charm and bundle test runner
description: |
  This is designed around the fail fast principle. Each bundle is composed of
  charms, each of those charms should have tests ranging from unit tests to
  integration tests. The bundle itself will have integration tests. Those
  tests should run from least expensive to most expensive in terms of time,
  failing as soon as possible. The theory is that if tests fail in the charms,
  the bundle cannot function. Bundletester will therefore pull all the charms
  and look for any tests it can find and run those prior running its own
  integration tests.
